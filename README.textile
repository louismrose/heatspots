h1. Heatspots

A super awesome app to display Twitter trends.


h2. Supplying data to Heatspots

New heatmaps can be posted by supplying a name and a set of triples of the form (latitude, longitude, strength). This data is supplied via an HTTP POST to either of the following paths:

bc. /heatmaps.xml
/heatmaps.json

For example, the following curl command adds a heatmap called Testing which contains two heatspots at latitude=2, longitude=4, strength=8 and latitude=1, longitude=2 and strength=3:

bc. curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"heatmap":{"name":"First","heatspots_attributes":[{"lat":1.0,"long":2.0,"strength":3.0},{"lat":3.0,"long":4.0,"strength":5.0}]}}' http://localhost:3000/heatmaps.json
